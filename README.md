**CSE422 Assignments (BRACU)**  

### CSE422 - Artificial Intelligence Assignments  

This repository contains all assignments and projects for the CSE422 Artificial Intelligence course.  
Here, I explore foundational AI concepts, including search algorithms, knowledge representation, machine learning, and natural language processing.  
Each assignment focuses on practical applications of AI theory, leveraging Python and relevant AI libraries for hands-on experience.

#### Topics Covered:
- Problem-solving using search algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS, A*)
- Heuristic-based optimization
- Knowledge representation and reasoning
- Machine learning models and training techniques
- Natural language processing basics

This repository serves as a portfolio of my AI coursework, showcasing code, analysis, and key learnings from each assignment.
